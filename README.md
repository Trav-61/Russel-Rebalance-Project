Russell 3000 Rebalance Analysis
Overview

This project analyzes the performance impact of Russell 3000 index reconstitutions by comparing securities added vs. deleted from the index around the rebalance date.

The workflow:

Extract index additions & deletions from PDFs published by FTSE Russell.

Convert to structured CSVs using pdfplumber and pandas.

Download historical data for additions, deletions, and the Russell 3000 index (^RUA) via yfinance.

Normalize prices to compare performance across tickers.

Aggregate & visualize median normalized performance of additions, deletions, and index over time.

This is designed as a quant-style research project that could be extended into a trading strategy.
